Tasks: Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Visual Question Generation (VQG) in the medical domain. 

Results of the VQA-Med-2021 challenge on crowdAI: 

- VQA task: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/imageclef-2021-vqa-med-vqa 
- VQG task: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/imageclef-2021-vqa-med-vqg


Data: 
--------------

VQA Data:  
- Training set: We provided the VQA-Med 2020 training data including 4,500 radiology images and 4,500 question-answer pairs (https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/imageclef-2020-vqa-med-vqa) 
- Validation set: Consists of 500 radiology images and associated questions/answers about Abnormality  
- Test set: 500 radiology images and 500 questions about abnormality. Participants were tasked with generating the answers based on the visual content of the images.  

The VQA-Med dataset was also used the ImageCLEF Caption & Concept Prediction Task: https://www.imageclef.org/2021/medical/caption 

VQG Data:
- The VQG 2021 validation set contains 200 questions associated with 85 radiology images. 

- The VQG 2021 test set includes 100 radiology images. Participants were tasked with generating distinct questions that are relevant to the visual content of the images. 

Evaluation Metrics
------------------

Accuracy: We used an adapted version of the accuracy metric from the general domain VQA task that considers exact matching of a participant provided answer and the ground truth answer.

BLEU: We used the BLEU metric to capture the similarity between a system-generated answer and the ground truth answer. 

The following preprocessing is applied before running the evaluation metrics on each answer: (i) each answer is converted to lower-case, and (ii) all punctuations are removed and the answer is tokenized to individual words.
